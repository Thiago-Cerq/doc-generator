The code is a simple program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum and average of the numbers. The code has two functions, `sum_numbers` and `average_numbers`. The `sum_numbers` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list. The `average_numbers` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of all the numbers in the list.

The code is executed as follows:

1. The program gets the list of numbers from the command line.
2. The program calls the `sum_numbers` function to calculate the sum of the numbers.
3. The program calls the `average_numbers` function to calculate the average of the numbers.
4. The program prints the sum and average of the numbers.

Here is an example of how the code can be used:

```
$ python agente.py 1 2 3 4 5
The sum of the numbers is 15
The average of the numbers is 3.0
```
