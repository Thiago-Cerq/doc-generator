The importance of refactoring lies in its ability to make the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and scale, ultimately leading to improved performance, reliability, and reduced bugs. Refactoring involves restructuring code without changing its external behavior, aiming to improve its design, readability, or efficiency. Regular refactoring is essential for developers to keep up with evolving technology and industry standards, ensuring that their code remains relevant and effective in the long run.
