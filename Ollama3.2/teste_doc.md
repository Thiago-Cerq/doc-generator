The final answer is:

**Agent Training Comparison**

The provided code demonstrates the training of three different agents: an agent using a simple random policy, an agent based on rules (Rule-Based Agent), and an agent using Q-Learning. Here's a comparison of their performance:

1.  **Agent Aleat√≥rio**: This agent uses a simple random policy to select actions. As expected, its performance is poor, with a low average reward. While this agent demonstrates the worst-case scenario for a reinforcement learning approach, it also highlights the importance of careful choice of the exploration strategy.
2.  **Rule-Based Agent**: The Rule-Based Agent uses a set of predefined rules to determine its actions based on the current state of the environment. This agent's performance improves over the random agent but still falls short of optimal performance. Its success demonstrates that simple rules can be effective in certain situations, especially when the environment has well-defined boundaries and constraints.
3.  **Agent com Q-Learning**: The Agent with Q-Learning uses an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a value function that estimates the expected reward for each state-action pair. This agent's performance far exceeds that of the previous two agents, demonstrating its ability to learn from experience and adapt to changing environments.

**Key Takeaways**

*   **Simple vs. Complex**: The comparison highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate exploration strategy (random vs. Q-Learning) when dealing with complex environments.
*   **Rule-Based Agents**: Even simple rule-based systems can be effective in well-defined situations, but their limitations become apparent in more complex scenarios.
*   **Q-Learning**: This advanced reinforcement learning algorithm is particularly well-suited for handling dynamic and uncertain environments, as it enables the agent to adapt its policy based on trial and error.

**Implications**

The comparison between these agents has significant implications for the design of reinforcement learning systems:

1.  **Agent Design**: The choice of exploration strategy, reward function, and architecture will significantly impact an agent's performance in a given environment.
2.  **Complexity Tolerance**: Simple agents may struggle with environments that require more sophisticated decision-making, while Q-Learning enables them to adapt to complex situations.
3.  **Real-World Applications**: The development of effective reinforcement learning algorithms for real-world applications demands a thorough understanding of the environment's dynamics and constraints.

**Future Work**

Further research directions could involve:

*   **Improved Exploration Strategies**: Developing more efficient exploration strategies, such as entropy-based or curiosity-driven methods, to help agents learn faster.
*   **Multi-Agent Systems**: Investigating how reinforcement learning can be applied to multi-agent systems, where multiple agents interact and adapt to each other's actions.
*   **Transfer Learning**: Exploring techniques for transferring knowledge from one environment to another, enabling agents to generalize their skills across different domains.

By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these agents, we can develop more effective reinforcement learning systems capable of handling a wide range of complex challenges.
