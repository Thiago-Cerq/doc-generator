The provided code appears to be a Python script for an agent that processes documents using a large language model (LLM) and updates the state of a lawsuit based on the document contents. To improve the code, consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of each function and variable, and use type hints to specify the expected data types. Additionally, error handling can be enhanced by catching specific exceptions and providing informative error messages. The code can also benefit from refactoring to reduce repetition and improve modularity. Overall, the code seems well-structured, but some improvements can be made to enhance readability, maintainability, and robustness.
