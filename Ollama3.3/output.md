The provided code is a Python script that appears to be an agent for processing legal documents. It utilizes various libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, asyncio for asynchronous operations, and a custom logging configuration. The script defines several functions, such as `agente`, `process_documents`, and `config_log`, which work together to process the documents and update the state of a `Lawsuit` object. To improve the code, consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of each function and variable, as well as implementing error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness. Additionally, refactoring the code to follow the single responsibility principle could enhance maintainability. The exact improvements would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
